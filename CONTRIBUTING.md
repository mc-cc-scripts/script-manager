# Contributing to Script Manager (SCM)
Thanks for your interest in SCM. Our goal is to make developing in CompuerCraft as easy as possible.

## Getting Started
If you want to contribute you can take a look at the existing issues [here](https://github.com/mc-cc-scripts/script-manager/issues).

Or create your own if you found a bug or something to improve.

You can create a pull request to resolve an issue which will then be reviewed by one of the core contributors.

- Make sure to always create a branch from `master` and check if it will merge cleanly before submitting your PR.
- If your PR is not getting reviewed, feel free to `@` a core contributor in the comments or your PR.
- Small commits are preferred but should be reasonable. (Don't put every text-change in an extra commit)
- If possible, add test a test program to your PR. You can just include a pastebin code.
